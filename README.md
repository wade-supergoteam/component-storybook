## Motivation
Provide ðŸ”¥ Super GO Team with reusable, themeable, code-covered and consistently documented visual components. Whilst primarily intended for display component any common abstractions can also be stored within this library. What should not be stored in this library is site or project specific functionality that can not be re-used without modification.

## Tools
The following tools have been used in the core functionality of this library

* [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) - *Basic application tooling for react based applications. Most suited for dynamic applications*
* [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/tutorial-react) - *Testing for Javascript*
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) - *Beautful documentation with powerful addons such as withKnobs(component interaction), withInfo(view react code), withStoryshot(take jest snapshots)*
* [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) - *Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress ðŸ’…*

## Technologies
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - *NodeJS runtime for Javascript*
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) - *Javascript package manager and environment*
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - *Declarative component based JSX. Write JavaScript then add HTML not the other way round.*
